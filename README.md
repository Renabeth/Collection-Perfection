### Description
Hello potential user! Collection Perfection is a program developed to allow for people to easily keep track of their collections, whether real or digital. With sites such as Discogs or Anilist allowing people to store one specific collection we thought "Why not be able to store all your collections in one place?" and with that in mind we began developing.

### Features
 - Registration and Log-in Functionality
 - Profile View that shows all of Users Collections as well as their Favorite Collection
 - Collection View that shows all of the Items contained within a selected Collection
 - Ability to Create and Delete Collections
 - Ability to Create and Delete Items
 - Ability to set collection as Favorite
 - Ability to locally set/change Profile Picture

### Instructions
 - Pull this code into your Intellij IDEA
 - Connect a key.json file for a firebase database to store data
 - Launch the code from the file **CollectionsApplication.java**
 - Register for an Account (or log-in)
